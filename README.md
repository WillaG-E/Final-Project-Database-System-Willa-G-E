Instructions on how to run your program

   1. Ensure that the dataset "MOCK_DATA.csv" is in the project folder
   2. Run the python file: main.py
   3. Enter command: 1, to load the data
   4. Enter command: 2, until you enter all of the searchable fields
   5. Enter command: 3, to find an exact search
      
           -enter the searchable field

           -enter the searchable field

           -enter the lower bound you want to look at
      
           -enter the higher bound you want to look at
      
   8. Enter command: 5, to delete the data you searched from a modified database
   9. Enter command: 0, to exit the Database System
